# My first circuit!

In this tutorial, we will attempt a few simple circuits with a simple to use online simulator, TinkerCAD. After which, we will apply the circuits that we have created into real circuits with components in our SSTuino Kit.

## Hello TinkerCAD!

Say you have an amazing idea at hand and would like to realise it, to which you are thinking: "Hmm, how can I evolve my idea into a real product?"

Meet TinkerCAD, one of the most popular classroom tools for creating simple designs from scratch. It is a simple to use 3D design tool that requires no downloading of software, as it is an online design program.

In this tutorial, we will go through the setting up process of TinkerCAD and have fun with a mini project!

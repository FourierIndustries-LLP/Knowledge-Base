SSTuino is an easy to use Wi-Fi enabled microcontroller, designed and fabricated by SST Alumni. Users can write programs to connect or control things over the Internet. It is derived from the SPEEEduino 1.1 with some improvements.

This tutorial is a simple guide on how to get started with the SSTuino.

## Setting up

**Note**: Please take your time and carefully go through this tutorial as it is the most crucial step to get your product working. It is also recommended to set this up before the SSTuino lessons starts with your parents to allow the smoothest possible experience. Learning devices with **parental control** will need to have their parents approve the driver installation.

Here are a list of things you require to go through this tutorial.

1. Your learning device
2. An active internet connection
3. The SSTuino Innovator's Kit

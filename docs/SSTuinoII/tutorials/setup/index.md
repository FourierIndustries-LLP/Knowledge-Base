> **Note:** Please do not plug in the SSTuino II and/or its components to your learning device or any power source first. We will get to it very soon. :)

In this tutorial, we will install the required software, boards and libraries. This allows all of your code that you will create in the future to be transferred onto the SSTuino II.

The SSTuino II has a large number of changes as compared to the SSTuino Classic. In the SSTuino II, we have simplified the installation process, allowing our users to get started in no time.

## Download Arduino IDE

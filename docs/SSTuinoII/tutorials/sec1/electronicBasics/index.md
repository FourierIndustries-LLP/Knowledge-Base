> **Note:** Please do not plug in the SSTuino II and/or its components to your learning device or any power source first. We will get to it very soon. Yes, very soon. :)

In this tutorial, we will talk about the SSTuino II and the SSTuino II Explorer Board. We will then explain the components that we have provided inside the SSTuino Innovator's Kit v2. 

Afterwards, we will explain about some circuit theory and electronics, before moving on to creating our first circuit with TinkerCAD - an online circuit simulation platform that we use.

## But first, let us light it up!

The one thing you have been waiting for... connecting the SSTuino II to power! Please connect the USB C-C cable to your learning device as shown:

You should see this!

## The story of the SSTuino II and the SSTuino II Explorer Board...

When we first started with the SSTuino Classic, we had time to go down to SST and observe the lessons conducted. One of the issues we noticed was with the ChangeMakers program, where the students tried to integrate the SSTuino into their products. Some of their projects were designed to be small or wearable, and the SSTuino Classic was simply too big for them to integrate into their projects.

ARM and then the COVID and then the supply chain issues...

## Up next...

Let us go into how the SSTuino Innovator's Kit works and start tinkering!

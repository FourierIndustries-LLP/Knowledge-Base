> **Note:** As we will be progressing towards tinkering and creating a circuits, a very important rule of thumb is to **not connect the circuit/project to power** before completing it. This helps to lower the risk of a component failing due to a improperly constructed circuit.

## What is Circuit Simulation?

Circuit Simulation is a great tool to test out your circuit design before assembling it in real life. This helps to reduce the possibility of your components being spolit due to a incorrect circuit design.  The platform we will be using for the SSTuino Innovator's Kit v2 is TinkerCAD.

## TinkerCAD

Say you have an amazing idea at hand and would like to realise it, to which you are thinking: "Hmm, how can I evolve my idea into a real product?"

Meet TinkerCAD, one of the most popular classroom tools for creating simple designs from scratch. It is a simple to use online 3D design and prototyping program.

Let us set up TinkerCAD and have fun with a mini project!

## Sign in to TinkerCAD

Signing in to TinkerCAD is very simple!

## Create a Circuit

There are a lot of functions inside TinkerCAD! However, for the purposes of the SSTuino we are going to use the "Circuits" function. Click on "Circuits" on the sidebar and click on create new circuit.

> **Note:** As we will be progressing towards tinkering and creating a circuit, a very important rule of thumb is to **not connect the circuit/project to power** before completing it. This helps to lower the risk of a component failing due to a improperly constructed circuit.

## How does circuits work?

A basic electrical circuit has 3 items:

1. Power Source (Battery, Wall Plug, etc.)
2. Wires/Conductors
3. Consumer (e.g. Light bulb, Speaker, Servo, etc.)

The power source provides the electrical energy required by the consumer by travelling through the wires. For example, the battery in this circuit provides energy to the LED.

To prevent too much energy from travelling through the circuit to the consumer, we "limit" it by using resistors. Now we go into Ohm's Law.

## Ohms Law

In a basic circuit, there are 3 variables we need to consider:

1. Voltage
2. Current
3. Resistance

Voltage is the potential difference measured across the component. For example, the potential difference measured across this AA battery is 1.5V. Unit is V.

Current is the rate of which the electricity flows throughout the circuit and is measured in Amperes. Unit is A.

The resistance resists the flow of electricity, to prevent the consumer from being damaged due to too much current flowing through it. Here are 2 examples, the one with resistor to the left, the one without on the right.

To keep it simple for learning, we have 2 main resistors provided in the SSTuino Innovator's Kit v2 that would be just nice for the other components provided.

## What does the components in my kit do?

We have included very cool components inside this kit for you to try out and integrate into your projects! Here are the brief functions of them:

### SSTuino II

The main brain of the kit. Has Wi-Fi Chip on it for IoT.  

### SSTuino II Explorer Board

Adapts the SSTuino II to an Arduino Uno form factor.

### USB-C Cable

Connects the SSTuino II to your LD. Also powers the SSTuino II.

### Breadboard

A board to plug in wires and components to create circuits.

### Dupont Cables (Wires)

Wires that can be used to create circuits.

### Bag of LEDs

Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) are small and efficient lights.

### Buzzer

A component that emits sound. Able to change pitch too.

### Push Button

A simple switch where circuit is closed when pressed.

### Potentiometer (10K Ohm)

An adjustable resistor with a knob. Max resistance: 10K Ohm.

### Light Dependent Resistor

A resistor that changes resistance due to light intensity.

### TMP36 Temperature Sensor

A small and simple to use temperature sensor.

### Ultrasonic Sensor

Measures distance by using ultrasonic waves. Used on cars too.

### PIR Proximity Sensor

Also known as "motion sensors".

### Servo

A small adjustable motor that rotates 180 degrees.

### RGB LED

LEDs with Red, Green, Blue in one "bulb". Very nice :)

### 330Ohm and 10KOhm resistor reel

Fixed value resistors for circuits.

## What if I need more components?

Content coming soon... :)

## Let us put it into practice!

Next, we will be simulating what we had learnt in this tutorial. We use TinkerCAD as the simulation platform for the SSTuino Innovator's Kit v2.

> **Note:** As we will be progressing towards tinkering and creating a circuits, a very important rule of thumb is to **not connect the circuit/project** to power before completing it. This helps to lower the risk of a component failing due to a improperly constructed circuit.

## How does circuits work?

Insert some basic electrical theory

## Ohms Law

Simple Ohm's Law 

## Let us put it into practice!

Next, we will be simulating what we had learnt in this tutorial. We use TinkerCAD as the simulation platform for the SSTuino Innovator's Kit v2.

# SSTuino Innovator's Kit v2

The SSTuino Innovator's Kit v2 is has a major redesign of the SSTuino and will be used from 2022 onwards. The SSTuino Classic has been replaced with the SSTuino II and the Explorer companion board.

## SSTuino II

The SSTuino II is a radical redesign of the SSTuino Classic. Inspired by the Arduino Nano Every, the SSTuino II has a significantly lower board size as compared to its predecessor. The smaller board size allows easier integration for its users while having more powerful microcontrollers.

## Explorer

The Explorer companion board is designed as a adaptor board to adapt the SSTuino II to a more famillar Arduino Uno form factor. It allows users to begin their journey in electronics and Internet-of-Things with ease. It also easily integrates to our use of TinkerCAD, an online Arduino Simulation service that allows our users to test out their circuits and code before implementing them.

<figure class="post__image post__image--left"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/25/arduinoPot22.png" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" srcset="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/25/responsive/arduinoPot22-xs.png 300w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/25/responsive/arduinoPot22-sm.png 480w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/25/responsive/arduinoPot22-md.png 749w"  alt="" width="162" height="161"></figure>
<p>The TMP36 Temperature Sensor is cheap and simple to use. It is able to measure temperature both below and above 0º C. It has no mercury as compared to traditional thermometers. Instead, it is a solid-state device that changes the voltage across a diode when the temperature changes.</p>
<p>It generates an analog signal that is proportionate to temperature change, which is very easy to read from a microcontroller like the SSTuino!</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1fvrp9fai1r">TinkerCAD Example</h2>
<p>Let's create a new circuit, and set up the TinkerCAD circuit like this:</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/25/arduinoPot40.png" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" srcset="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/25/responsive/arduinoPot40-xs.png 300w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/25/responsive/arduinoPot40-sm.png 480w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/25/responsive/arduinoPot40-md.png 749w"  alt="" width="1837" height="854"></figure>
<p>Next, we will program it in blocks such that it outputs temperature to the serial monitor, with options to calibrate the sensor by adding or subtracting the result.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/25/arduinoPot24.png" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" srcset="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/25/responsive/arduinoPot24-xs.png 300w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/25/responsive/arduinoPot24-sm.png 480w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/25/responsive/arduinoPot24-md.png 749w"  alt="" width="543" height="99"></figure>
<p>This is what it looks like when you start the simulation:</p>

<h3 id="mcetoc_1fvrp9fai1s">Explanation of Text Code</h3>
<p>Let's download the code from TinkerCAD and open it in the Arduino IDE. Attached below is an "explained" version of the code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">
int temp = 0; // Setup the variable 'temp' as an integer and starts as 0

void setup()
{
  pinMode(A0, INPUT); //initilise pin A0 as input
  Serial.begin(9600); //initilise serial

}

void loop()
{
  temp = (-40 + 0.488155 * (analogRead(A0) - 20) + 0); //calculations to convert voltage drop measured from A0 into temperature. Adjust 0 to calibrate sensor.
  Serial.println(temp); //print variable 'temp' to serial monitor
}
</code></pre>
<p>Let's try this on the SSTuino!</p>
<p class="msg msg--warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> To prevent damage to your Learning Device or your components, please <strong>do not connect the SSTuino to your LD or power supply</strong> when you are wiring up your circuit. </p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1fvrr1ms32g">Challenge yourself</h2>
<p>Using the bar graph example we did in the previous tutorials, how would you set the temperature sensor up such that when it is hotter, more LEDs will light up?</p>

</div>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1fvmoha0d3">Functions</h2>
<p>Here are the 3 basic parts that you would have in the code.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/24/SSTuinoIoT8.png" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" srcset="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/24/responsive/SSTuinoIoT8-xs.png 300w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/24/responsive/SSTuinoIoT8-sm.png 480w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/24/responsive/SSTuinoIoT8-md.png 749w"  alt="" width="897" height="387"></figure>
<p>However, you can separate code into functions, which create modular pieces of code that perform a defined task. Here are some advantages when you standardise code fragments into functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Functions help the programmer to stay organised and help to conceptualise the program.</li>
<li>Functions codify one function in one place so that it only has to be thought out and debugged once.</li>
<li>If the code has to be changed, functions also reduce the errors in modification.</li>
</ul>
<p>Functions can also help to have smaller code, especially if particular lines of code are used repeatedly in the program. Although functions have many advantages, do take note that Arduino still requires <code><strong>void setup()</strong></code> and <code><strong>void loop()</strong></code> for the program to work. You can place your additional functions outside of them. Now let's make use of previous examples and implement functions!</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1fvp2st7fc">Ultrasonic Distance Sensor Example</h3>
<p>We are going to continue to use this circuit from our previous example.</p>
<p class="msg msg--warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> To prevent damage to your Learning Device or your components, please <strong>do not connect the SSTuino to your LD or power supply</strong> when you are wiring up your circuit. </p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/24/arduinoPot19.png" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" srcset="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/24/responsive/arduinoPot19-xs.png 300w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/24/responsive/arduinoPot19-sm.png 480w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/24/responsive/arduinoPot19-md.png 749w"  alt="" width="1758" height="970"></figure>
<p>Here is an edited text version of the blocks code from TinkerCAD. Firstly the device initialises the Serial Monitor. Note that it does not declare the pins inside setup(). We will cover that in the function! 😁</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now we will do up the code in loop(). We make the serial print the time taken for the sound wave to bounce back using the function readUltrasonicDistance(5,6) in microseconds and multiply that by half the speed of sound to display the distance in cm.</p>
<p class="msg msg--info"><strong>Tip: </strong>The speed of sound is 0.0343 centimetre/microsecond. We half that to 0.01723 because the time taken for the sound to bounce back is 2x the total distance (time taken to the object + time taken from the object)</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">
void loop()
{
  Serial.println(0.01723 * readUltrasonicDistance(5, 6));
}
</code></pre>
<p>And finally the function! We declare it as long as we can use it in the calculation in loop(). The function essentially tells the sensor to "fire" the ultrasonic wave and read the time taken for it to travel to and fro.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">
long readUltrasonicDistance(int triggerPin, int echoPin)
{
  pinMode(triggerPin, OUTPUT);  // Clear the trigger
  digitalWrite(triggerPin, LOW);
  delayMicroseconds(2);
  // Sets the trigger pin to HIGH state for 10 microseconds
  digitalWrite(triggerPin, HIGH);
  delayMicroseconds(10);
  digitalWrite(triggerPin, LOW);
  pinMode(echoPin, INPUT);
  // Reads the echo pin, and returns the sound wave travel time in microseconds
  return pulseIn(echoPin, HIGH);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Let's try this out in the Arduino IDE! What other functions would you like to add to this code?</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1fvp2st7fd">Potentiometer Example</h3>
<p>Let's try out another simple example with the Potentiometer! Set up the circuit as shown:</p>
<p class="msg msg--warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> To prevent damage to your Learning Device or your components, please <strong>do not connect the SSTuino to your LD or power supply</strong> when you are wiring up your circuit. </p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/24/arduinoPot4.png" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" srcset="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/24/responsive/arduinoPot4-xs.png 300w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/24/responsive/arduinoPot4-sm.png 480w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/24/responsive/arduinoPot4-md.png 749w"  alt="" width="1159" height="563"></figure>
<p>Head over to the Arduino IDE and set up the code. First, let's declare the serial port, input and output pins:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  pinMode(A0, INPUT);
  pinMode(6, OUTPUT);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Next, let's leave <code><strong>void loop()</strong></code> alone for a bit 😆 and set up functions! You can name your functions whatever you want, as long as it is a single word.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">
void pwmLed() {
	analogWrite(6, (analogRead(A0) / 4));
}

void helloWorld() {
Serial.println(Hello, World!);
}
</code></pre>
<p>With this, we have just created 2 functions! Let us place them inside <code><strong>void loop()</strong></code></p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">
void loop()
{
  helloWorld();
  pwmLed();
}
</code></pre>
<p>The advantage of using functions in this scenario is that if I would like to not make a section of code run, I do not need to comment out all the lines inside <code><strong>void loop()</strong></code>. Instead, I just have to comment out the function as so!</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">
void loop()
{
  //helloWorld(); // This code will not be run.
  pwmLed();
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1fvp2st7fe">Limitations of Block Code</h2>
<p>Programming with blocks is super simple! Just plop them in and you are good to go! Block coding is a great tool to get people started with little to no programming knowledge. However, as we move to more advanced tutorials like the Internet of Things, block coding would not be able to be used as it is rather limited. While we love introductory tools such as TinkerCAD's block coding functionality, we would like our students to move on to text-based programming languages too!</p>
<p>Here are some limitations of block code:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inability to support external libraries/locked into the platform </li>
<li>Inability to use sensors that are not supported by the platform</li>
<li>Delay based programming, not suitable for time-sensitive applications</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1fvp2st7ff">"Multitasking" your SSTuino</h2>
<p>Let's make the device "multitask"! For the examples that we have covered so far, we have always used <code><strong>delay()</strong></code> to say light up an LED for 1 second. However, although <code><strong>delay()</strong></code> is handy and works for basic examples, it shouldn't be used in the real world...</p>
<p>Wait, what? 🤯</p>
<p>Why shouldn't we use <code><strong>delay()</strong></code>? That is because delay is a blocking function. For example, when you do <code><strong>delay(1000)</strong></code>, the Arduino stops on that line for one second. Blocking functions prevent a program from doing anything else until that particular task has been completed. If you need multiple tasks to occur at the same time, you simply cannot use <strong><code>delay()</code></strong>. If your program requires you to constantly read data (e.g. Ultrasonic Sensor), you should avoid using the delay function.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1fvp2st7fg">millis() instead of delay()</h3>
<p>Here comes <code><strong>millis()</strong></code> to the rescue! 🥳 When called, it returns the number of milliseconds that have passed since the program first started. By doing some simple math and comparison, you can verify how much time has passed without blocking your code! Let's take a look at a blink sketch that does not use the <code><strong>delay()</strong></code> function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">
// constants won't change. Used here to set a pin number :
const int ledPin =  13;      // the number of the LED pin

// Variables will change :
int ledState = LOW;             // ledState used to set the LED

// Generally, you should use "unsigned long" for variables that hold time
// The value will quickly become too large for an int to store
unsigned long previousMillis = 0;        // will store last time LED was updated

// constants won't change :
const long interval = 1000;           // interval at which to blink (milliseconds)

void setup() {
  // set the digital pin as output:
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // here is where you'd put code that needs to be running all the time.

  // check to see if it's time to blink the LED; that is, if the
  // difference between the current time and last time you blinked
  // the LED is bigger than the interval at which you want to
  // blink the LED.
  unsigned long currentMillis = millis();

  if (currentMillis - previousMillis &gt;= interval) {
    // save the last time you blinked the LED
    previousMillis = currentMillis;

    // if the LED is off turn it on and vice-versa:
    if (ledState == LOW) {
      ledState = HIGH;
    } else {
      ledState = LOW;
    }

    // set the LED with the ledState of the variable:
    digitalWrite(ledPin, ledState);
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>How the code works is that it subtracts the previously recorded time (previousMillis) from the current time (currentMillis). If the remainder is greater than the interval (1000 milliseconds), the program updates the previousMillis variable to the current time, and either turn the LED on or off.</p>
<p>As the program is non-blocking, any code that is added outside of the first if statement should work correctly. You can now add other tasks and your LED will blink every second!</p>
<p>Using the <code><strong>millis()</strong></code> function does take a bit more work than using the <code><strong>delay()</strong></code> function but will be worth it if the program needs to multitask.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1fvpo53oi1c">Ultrasonic Sensor and Buzzer Example</h3>
<p>Let's wire up your circuit as so!</p>
<p class="msg msg--warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> To prevent damage to your Learning Device or your components, please <strong>do not connect the SSTuino to your LD or power supply</strong> when you are wiring up your circuit. </p>

<p>Next, head over to the Arduino IDE where we will program the ultrasonic sensor to:</p>
<ul>
<li>trigger the ultrasonic wave every 1 millisecond</li>
<li>print the distance to the serial monitor every 1 second</li>
<li>turn on and off a buzzer every second if the distance is less than 30cm</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">
const int trigPin = 5; //set pin variables
const int echoPin = 6;
const int buzzerPin = 13;

int trigState = LOW; //state of trigPin
int interval = 1; // interval in milliseconds at which trigPin turns on
int interval2 = 1000; //time in milliseconds at which the distance is printed in serial monitors
int printState = LOW; //whether or not to print distance
int buzzer = LOW; //whether or not buzzer is on
unsigned long previousMillis = 0; //microsecond at which the pin was last writen

void setup()
{
  Serial.begin(9600); //begin serial communication
  pinMode(trigPin,OUTPUT); //set pinmodes
  pinMode(echoPin,INPUT);<br>  pinMode(buzzerPin,OUTPUT);
}

void loop()
{
  unsigned long currentMillis = millis(); //time in milliseconds from which the code was started
  if (currentMillis-previousMillis &gt;= interval) { //check "blink without delay" code
    previousMillis = currentMillis;// 
    if (trigState == LOW){
      (trigState = HIGH);
    }
    else {
      (trigState = LOW);
    }
  }
  // printing speed in serial monitor at an interval of 1s
  if (currentMillis-previousMillis &gt;= interval2) { //check "blink without delay" code
    previousMillis = currentMillis;
    if (printState == LOW){
      (printState = HIGH);
    }
    else {
      (printState = LOW);
    }
  }
  digitalWrite(trigPin,trigState); // Fire the pulse to measure distance
  int duration, distance; //variables
  duration = pulseIn(echoPin,HIGH); // Measure the time taken for the pulse
  distance = duration * 0.01723; // Calculate speed
  if (printState = HIGH){  //print the data to the serial monitor
  Serial.print(distance);
  Serial.println("cm");}
  
  if (distance &lt;= 30){ //If distance &lt;30cm, buzzer will sound at an interval of 1s.
    if (currentMillis-previousMillis &gt;= interval2) { //check "blink without delay" code
    previousMillis = currentMillis;
    if (buzzer == LOW){

<h2 id="mcetoc_1fvan9u4ng">About the Component</h2>
<figure class="post__image post__image--right"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/22/LDR.jpeg" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" srcset="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/22/responsive/LDR-xs.jpeg 300w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/22/responsive/LDR-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/22/responsive/LDR-md.jpeg 749w"  alt="" width="171" height="160"></figure>
<p>The Light Dependent Resistor (LDR/Photoresistor) is a type of resistor that reacts with light. When the amount of light it detects changes, the resistance changes. However, as there are many types of LDRs around, the way they change resistance with the amount of light would be different.</p>
<p>As the LDR reacts to the amount of light it receives, it is very useful as automatic brightness control on your laptops and mobile devices.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1fvanutqb1l">Reading LDR value</h2>
<p>Let's create a new circuit on TinkerCAD like this:</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/22/arduinoPot30.png" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" srcset="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/22/responsive/arduinoPot30-xs.png 300w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/22/responsive/arduinoPot30-sm.png 480w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/22/responsive/arduinoPot30-md.png 749w"  alt="" width="1852" height="984"></figure>
<p>We will read the value from the LDR and output it on the serial monitor:</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/22/arduinoPot14.png" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" srcset="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/22/responsive/arduinoPot14-xs.png 300w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/22/responsive/arduinoPot14-sm.png 480w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/22/responsive/arduinoPot14-md.png 749w"  alt="" width="447" height="109"></figure>
<p>When running the simulation, open up the serial monitor. The result should look something like this:</p>
<figure class="post__video"><video loading="lazy" width="300" height="150" playsinline="" autoplay="autoplay" muted="" loop="loop" data-mce-fragment="1">
    <source src="media/files/arduinoPot31.mp4" type="video/mp4" /></video></figure>
<p>While I change the light intensity of the LDR, the readings also change.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1fvi5ukvv4e">Calibration of the sensor</h3>
<p>As the sensor has multiple variations, let's check yours out! Construct the circuit on your SSTuino!</p>
<p class="msg msg--warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> To prevent damage to your Learning Device or your components, please <strong>do not connect the SSTuino to your LD or power supply</strong> when you are wiring up your circuit. </p>
<p>After you are done uploading the code, open the serial monitor. Now note down the value when the room is lit. Afterwards, turn off the lights in the room and note down the value again. We will need this data afterwards to tell when to turn on the RGB LED.</p>
<p class="msg msg--info"><strong>Tip: </strong>If the lights in the room are unable to be turned off, you can use your hands to cover the LDR. Similarly, if your environment is originally dark, you can use the torch from your mobile device to shine at it.</p>
<figure class="post__video"><video loading="lazy" width="300" height="150" playsinline="" autoplay="autoplay" muted="" loop="loop" data-mce-fragment="1">
    <source src="media/files/arduinoPot46.mp4" type="video/mp4" /></video></figure>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1fvao1ho31r">Control RGB LED</h2>
<p>Now let us make the sensor useful! Make it such that the LED will light up when the environment darkens, and you can use the potentiometer to control the colour. To do so, we edit our code to something like this:</p>
<p class="msg msg--info"><strong>Tip: </strong>Use the average of your bright and dark value and input it inside the area (Read analog pin A0 &lt; 512)</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/22/arduinoPot32.png" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" srcset="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/22/responsive/arduinoPot32-xs.png 300w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/22/responsive/arduinoPot32-sm.png 480w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/22/responsive/arduinoPot32-md.png 749w"  alt="" width="530" height="374"></figure>
<p>Afterwards, upload the code to the SSTuino. It should look like this:</p>
<figure class="post__video"><video loading="lazy" width="300" height="150" playsinline="" autoplay="autoplay" muted="" loop="loop" data-mce-fragment="1">

<figure class="post__image post__image--left"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/23/arduinoPot17.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" srcset="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/23/responsive/arduinoPot17-xs.jpg 300w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/23/responsive/arduinoPot17-sm.jpg 480w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/23/responsive/arduinoPot17-md.jpg 749w"  alt="" width="221" height="159"></figure>
<p>The ultrasonic distance sensor uses ultrasonic waves - a very high-pitched sound that we cannot hear to measure the distance it is from an object.</p>
<p>It is in a <strong>transceiver</strong> configuration, where both the transmitter and receiver are on the same sensor.</p>
<p>One of the uses of the ultrasonic distance sensor is in the automotive industry. They are usually used as reverse warning sensors but are increasingly used in self-driving vehicles.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/23/arduinoPot21.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" srcset="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/23/responsive/arduinoPot21-xs.jpg 300w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/23/responsive/arduinoPot21-sm.jpg 480w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/23/responsive/arduinoPot21-md.jpg 749w"  alt="" width="374" height="273"></figure>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1fvap7cft67">Using the Sensor</h2>
<p>The ultrasonic sensor we are going to use is the HC-SR04, which is commonly used in Arduino circuits:</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--right"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/23/arduinoPot18.png" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" srcset="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/23/responsive/arduinoPot18-xs.png 300w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/23/responsive/arduinoPot18-sm.png 480w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/23/responsive/arduinoPot18-md.png 749w"  alt="" width="221" height="129"></figure>
<p class="msg msg--info"><strong>Note:</strong> We are using the 4 pin sensor instead of the 3 pin version, which can be found by typing <strong>ultrasonic sensor </strong>in the component search bar.</p>
<p>Let us go into TinkerCAD and create a new circuit. We are going to assemble it like this:</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/23/arduinoPot19.png" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" srcset="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/23/responsive/arduinoPot19-xs.png 300w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/23/responsive/arduinoPot19-sm.png 480w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/23/responsive/arduinoPot19-md.png 749w"  alt="" width="1758" height="970"></figure>
<p>We are going to program the Arduino such that the ultrasonic distance sensor will output the distance measured into the serial monitor. The code blocks have been extensively simplified by TinkerCAD and it just looks like this:</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/23/arduinoPot20.png" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" srcset="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/23/responsive/arduinoPot20-xs.png 300w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/23/responsive/arduinoPot20-sm.png 480w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/23/responsive/arduinoPot20-md.png 749w"  alt="" width="1708" height="130"></figure>
<p>This is what you will see when you start the simulation:</p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1fvdca6hg25">About the Piezo</h2>
<figure class="post__image post__image--left"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/21/146-2.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" srcset="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/21/responsive/146-2-xs.jpg 300w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/21/responsive/146-2-sm.jpg 480w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/21/responsive/146-2-md.jpg 749w"  alt="" width="101" height="101"></figure>
<p>The Piezo Buzzer provided in the kit uses the piezoelectric effect to produce sound. They are easy to drive (i.e. do not need much energy to generate sound) and are also cheap to produce.</p>
<p>Generally, Piezo Buzzers are sold in two types:</p>
<ul>
<li>A fixed frequency with resonator (will have a fixed pitch when turned on)</li>
<li>A variable frequency without a resonator (pitch can be controlled externally)</li>
</ul>
<p>The buzzer provided in the kit does not come with a resonator so we can change its pitch using the SSTuino.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1fvdca6hg27">TinkerCAD Exercise</h2>
<p>Let's set up the buzzer inside TinkerCAD! Configure your circuit like this:</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/21/arduinoPot8-2.png" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" srcset="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/21/responsive/arduinoPot8-2-xs.png 300w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/21/responsive/arduinoPot8-2-sm.png 480w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/21/responsive/arduinoPot8-2-md.png 749w"  alt="" width="1197" height="644"></figure>
<p>I am going to play 3 tones on the harmonic scale. Below is how I programmed it. Can you program it to play up to 1 full scale? <em>(Do, Re, Mi, Fa, So, La, Ti Do!)</em></p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/21/arduinoPot9.png" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" srcset="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/21/responsive/arduinoPot9-xs.png 300w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/21/responsive/arduinoPot9-sm.png 480w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/21/responsive/arduinoPot9-md.png 749w"  alt="" width="879" height="254"></figure>
<p>Let's create this circuit on the SSTuino! This is what it looks like:</p>
<p class="msg msg--warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> To prevent damage to your Learning Device or your components, please <strong>do not connect the SSTuino to your LD or power supply</strong> when you are wiring up your circuit. </p>
<pre>Insert video here</pre>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1fvdca6hg28">Pieno</h2>
<p>We are now going to use the potentiometer to control the tone of the speaker. When you turn the knob on the potentiometer, the pitch of the speaker will change. With the same circuit as the previous exercise, we are going to tweak the code for the Pieno.</p>
<p>First, we will need to create a new variable called pot. In this exercise, we are going to use the <strong>map to range </strong>function. The potentiometer has a range from <strong>0 to 1023</strong>, but the speaker has an output range of <strong>35 to 127</strong>. By mapping the range, we can make sure that when the potentiometer is at one end of the input range, the speaker is also at one end of its output range.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/21/arduinoPot10.png" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" srcset="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/21/responsive/arduinoPot10-xs.png 300w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/21/responsive/arduinoPot10-sm.png 480w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/21/responsive/arduinoPot10-md.png 749w"  alt="" width="494" height="155"></figure>
<p>After you have tried this out, run the simulation and create your own music!</p>
<p>Let's try this on the SSTuino!</p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1fvdca6hg29">Enhance the pieno</h2>
<p>Would it be possible to add more functions to the <em>pieno</em>? Sure thing! Let us add 2 more buttons to the circuit as shown:</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/21/arduinoPot11-2.png" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" srcset="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/21/responsive/arduinoPot11-2-xs.png 300w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/21/responsive/arduinoPot11-2-sm.png 480w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/21/responsive/arduinoPot11-2-md.png 749w"  alt="" width="1164" height="635"></figure>
<p>We will add two functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>A button to stop the music (mute button)</li>
<li>A button to make the piezo beep intermittently</li>
</ul>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/21/arduinoPot12.png" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" srcset="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/21/responsive/arduinoPot12-xs.png 300w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/21/responsive/arduinoPot12-sm.png 480w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/21/responsive/arduinoPot12-md.png 749w"  alt="" width="396" height="385"></figure>

<p class="msg msg--warning"><strong>Warning: </strong>The pinout for the PIR sensor that is provided with TinkerCAD is different from the kit! We will be talking about the sensor provided in the kit in the sections below.</p>
<p>Here are the pinout differences between the two sensors:</p>

<h3 id="mcetoc_1fv4sotai1n">Fresnel Lens</h3>
<p>The lens for the PIR sensor helps it to detect objects from a distance! However, this will not work for a classroom environment because there will be too many people attempting this and as a result, the sensor will always detect movement! 🤣</p>
<p>To prevent this, let us remove the lens to reduce the detection range!</p>

<p>Let's build the circuit on the SSTuino and we will be moving into programming this example with the Arduino IDE!</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1fv4sotai1o">Moving into Arduino IDE</h2>
<p>Let's start programming on the Arduino IDE! Open up the Arduino app. A new window should appear.</p>
<p>Let's make use of this template we learned previously:</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/20/SSTuinoIoT8.png" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" srcset="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/20/responsive/SSTuinoIoT8-xs.png 300w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/20/responsive/SSTuinoIoT8-sm.png 480w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/20/responsive/SSTuinoIoT8-md.png 749w"  alt="" width="897" height="387"></figure>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1fv4sotai1p">Declaration</h3>
<p>Our code only requires us to light up the LED and send the data to the serial monitor, so I don't think there are any variables to declare. Alternatively, you can do so if you wish to for the numbering of the pins.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1fv4sotai1q">Setup</h3>
<p>This section will set up the input pins, output pins and indicate that we want to use the serial monitor.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">void setup() 
{ 
    pinMode(6, INPUT); // This pin will receive the input signal from the PIR Sensor
    pinMode(5, OUTPUT); // This pin will turn on and off the LED
    Serial.begin(9600); // This will initialise the serial monitor
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1fv4sotai1r">Loop</h3>
<p>This section will run the code forever when the SSTuino is powered on.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">void loop() 
{
  if (digitalRead(6) == 1) {
    digitalWrite(5, HIGH); // This if statement states that if the PIR sensor detects movement, the LED will light up and serial monitor will print a new line "Detected!"
    Serial.println("Detected!");
  } else {
    digitalWrite(5, LOW); //Else the LED will turn off and print a new line "Not Detected!"
    Serial.println("Not Detected!");
  }
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1fv4sotai1s">Your Turn</h2>
<p>Let's try this out! This is what it looks like on the SSTuino:</p>
<pre>Insert video here</pre>
<p class="msg msg--success">Let's make some changes: Could you make the LED flash on and off every second once the PIR sensor detects movement?</p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1fut95ja3dt">About the Potentiometer</h2>
<p>The potentiometer is essentially a variable resistor. But instead of having 2 pins, it has 3 pins.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/19/arduinoPot1.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" srcset="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/19/responsive/arduinoPot1-xs.jpg 300w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/19/responsive/arduinoPot1-sm.jpg 480w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/19/responsive/arduinoPot1-md.jpg 749w"  alt="" width="151" height="151">
<figcaption >The Bourns 3386F 10K Ohm Potentiometer provided in the kit.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Potentiometers are used frequently and commonly on electronic devices. A simple example would be the volume knob on speakers or the light dimmers in your house!</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--left"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/19/arduinoPot.png" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" srcset="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/19/responsive/arduinoPot-xs.png 300w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/19/responsive/arduinoPot-sm.png 480w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/19/responsive/arduinoPot-md.png 749w"  alt="" width="104" height="88"></figure>
<p>The potentiometer that is provided in the kit is a 10K Ohm potentiometer, which means that when the knob is turned fully to one end it is 0 Ohm, while at the other end it is 10K Ohm.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1fut95ja4dv">Using the Potentiometer</h2>
<p>Let us fire up TinkerCAD, create a new circuit and configure your circuit like this:</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/19/arduinoPot2.png" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" srcset="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/19/responsive/arduinoPot2-xs.png 300w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/19/responsive/arduinoPot2-sm.png 480w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/19/responsive/arduinoPot2-md.png 749w"  alt="" width="1260" height="579"></figure>
<p class="msg msg--info">The potentiometer inside TinkerCAD might look different from the one provided in the kit. Fret not as they are the same, but do ensure that the potentiometer inside TinkerCAD is 10k Ohm. 🙂</p>
<p>Let us program the board to output the potentiometer reading in our serial monitor!</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/19/arduinoPot3.png" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" srcset="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/19/responsive/arduinoPot3-xs.png 300w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/19/responsive/arduinoPot3-sm.png 480w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/19/responsive/arduinoPot3-md.png 749w"  alt="" width="434" height="110"></figure>
<p>Once you are done with the circuit and code, let's run the simulation and open the serial monitor!</p>
<figure class="post__video"><video loading="lazy" width="300" height="150" playsinline="" autoplay="autoplay" muted="" loop="loop" data-mce-fragment="1">
    <source src="media/files/arduinoPot34.mp4" type="video/mp4" /></video></figure>
<p>As you interact with the knob on the potentiometer, you should see the number change from 0 to 1023. Why does this happen? 🤔 Onboard the SSTuino, there is an Analog to Digital Converter (ADC), and it has a resolution of 10 bits. </p>
<p>Let us set up this circuit on the SSTuino!</p>
<p class="msg msg--warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> To prevent damage to your Learning Device or your components, please <strong>do not connect the SSTuino to your LD or power supply</strong> when you are wiring up your circuit. </p>
<p>There is a cool feature inside the Arduino IDE! You can open the serial plotter as an alternative to the serial monitor as shown:</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/19/arduinoPot35.png" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" srcset="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/19/responsive/arduinoPot35-xs.png 300w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/19/responsive/arduinoPot35-sm.png 480w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/19/responsive/arduinoPot35-md.png 749w"  alt="" width="291" height="184"></figure>
<p>Here is what it looks like on the SSTuino II:</p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1fut95ja4e0">LED Speed Control</h2>
<p>Let us make use of the potentiometer reading we have from the SSTuino to alter the blinking speed of the LED! Fire up TinkerCAD and make a circuit like so:</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/19/arduinoPot4.png" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" srcset="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/19/responsive/arduinoPot4-xs.png 300w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/19/responsive/arduinoPot4-sm.png 480w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/19/responsive/arduinoPot4-md.png 749w"  alt="" width="1159" height="563"></figure>
<p>We are going to edit the code such that the location of the knob will affect the speed at which the LED blinks:</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/19/arduinoPot5.png" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" srcset="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/19/responsive/arduinoPot5-xs.png 300w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/19/responsive/arduinoPot5-sm.png 480w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/19/responsive/arduinoPot5-md.png 749w"  alt="" width="497" height="282"></figure>
<p>Here is what it looks like when I press <strong>Start Simulation:</strong></p>

<p>Let us build the circuit on the SSTuino! Here is what it looks like:</p>
<p class="msg msg--warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> To prevent damage to your Learning Device or your components, please <strong>do not connect the SSTuino to your LD or power supply</strong> when you are wiring up your circuit. </p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1fut95ja4e1">LED Brightness Control</h2>
<p>We will use SSTuino's PWM output function to control the brightness of the LED. There are some pins with the wavy `~` sign, which means that it can output PWM signals. </p>
<p>PWM stands for Pulse Width Modulation. The pin would output a series of square waves, and depending on the duty cycle, adjusts the width of the square wave. What it essentially does is that it turns on and off the component very quickly, such that our eyes cannot see the difference.</p>
<p>In the diagram below, you can see how the duty cycle is adjusted by changing the width of the square wave. When the duty cycle is 0, it turns off the component. From 0 to 100, it gradually increases the intensity and is a full power when at 100% duty cycle.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/19/Screenshot-2022-03-24-at-12.00.59.png" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" srcset="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/19/responsive/Screenshot-2022-03-24-at-12.00.59-xs.png 300w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/19/responsive/Screenshot-2022-03-24-at-12.00.59-sm.png 480w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/19/responsive/Screenshot-2022-03-24-at-12.00.59-md.png 749w"  alt="" width="231" height="252"></figure>
<p>For this exercise, we will use the same circuit and just edit the code:</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/19/arduinoPot6.png" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" srcset="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/19/responsive/arduinoPot6-xs.png 300w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/19/responsive/arduinoPot6-sm.png 480w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/19/responsive/arduinoPot6-md.png 749w"  alt="" width="538" height="134"></figure>
<p>The input is divided by 4 as the range of the PWM output is only from 0-255, while the Analog input is from 0 to 1024<br><br>This is the result I should get:</p>
<figure class="post__video"><video loading="lazy" width="300" height="150" playsinline="" autoplay="autoplay" muted="" loop="loop" data-mce-fragment="1">
    <source src="media/files/arduinoPot37.mp4" type="video/mp4" /></video></figure>
<p>Copy this circuit over to your SSTuino board setup.</p>
<p class="msg msg--warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> To prevent damage to your Learning Device or your components, please <strong>do not connect the SSTuino to your LD or power supply</strong> when you are wiring up your circuit. </p>
<p>Here is what it looks like on the SSTuino II:</p>

    <source src="media/files/arduinoPot44.mp4" type="video/mp4" /></video></figure>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1fut95ja4e3">Bar Graph</h2>
<p>Let us control many LEDs using the Potentiometer! The aim is to vary the number of LEDs lit up when the knob of the potentiometer is turned.</p>
<p>Setup the circuit in TinkerCAD as shown below:</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/19/arduinoPot25.png" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" srcset="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/19/responsive/arduinoPot25-xs.png 300w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/19/responsive/arduinoPot25-sm.png 480w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/19/responsive/arduinoPot25-md.png 749w"  alt="" width="425" height="507"></figure>
<p>In the code, we will be using the <strong>map</strong> function to map the range of the potentiometer input (0 - 1023) to the output pins (2 - 7). The higher the readout from the potentiometer, the more LEDs are light up.</p>
<p>Below is an embed of the TinkerCAD example. Press on <strong>code</strong> to see the block code. Do you have alternative ways?</p>

<p>In text programming, you can simplify this too! How can it be done?</p>
<p>This is how it works on the SSTuino II:</p>

<p><strong>Declaration - </strong>Used to declare the libraries and variables used in the code. For example, the variable <code>temp</code> is declared as an integer and has the starting value of 0.</p>
<p><strong>Setup - </strong>Code that is run once to set up your SSTuino. For example, the <code>Serial.begin(9600);</code> tells it to start the serial monitor with a baud rate (speed) of 9600bps (bits per second)</p>
<p><strong>Loop - </strong>Code that is repeated forever, when the microcontroller is powered. For example, the code inside the example tells it to output temperature data using the serial monitor every 10 milliseconds.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1fvhtc1p6gg">Data Types</h2>
<p>In programming, there are various data types. Some are used to store text, and others are used to store more complicated types of data. The common data types include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>String (<code>String</code>)</strong> - a combination of characters on the keyboard (letters, numbers symbols)</li>
<li><strong>Character (<code>char</code>)</strong> - single letters like <code>'a'</code></li>
<li><strong>Integer (<code>int</code>)</strong> - whole numbers ranging from -32,768 to +32,767</li>
<li><strong>Float (<code>float</code>) </strong>- numbers that contain decimal points like 25.6</li>
<li><strong>Boolean (<code>bool</code>) </strong>- either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. Can also be used to represent a pin state like <code>HIGH</code> or <code>LOW</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In many programming languages, variables must be declared before they can be used. Here are some examples that are used in Arduino:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">String password = "hello world";
int temp = 0;
bool logicStatement = false;
bool ledState = HIGH;
float temperature = 25.6;
</code></pre>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1fvhtc1p6gh">Conversion of Data Types</h2>
<p>There are expressions that contain variables and constants of different data types. If you need to calculate the expressions, they will need to be converted to the same data type. Below are some common conversion types to help you.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1fvhtc1p6gi">String to Int</h3>
<p><code>toInt()</code> - Converts String to Integer. The input string should start with an integer. If the string contains non-integers, the function will stop performing the conversion. In the event where the conversion could not be performed as the String does not start with an integer, a zero (data type: long) is returned. </p>
<h4 id="mcetoc_1fvhtc1p6gj">Example Code</h4>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);

  String myString = "20";
  int myInt = myString.toInt(); //This is where the toInt() Function is used
  Serial.println(myInt);
}

void loop() {
}
</code></pre>
<p>You can copy this code to your Arduino IDE and try it out!</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1fvhtc1p6gk">String to Float</h3>
<p><code>toFloat()</code> - Converts String to Float. The input string should start with a digit. If the string contains non-digits, the function will stop performing the conversion. In the event where the conversion could not be performed as the String does not start with a digit, a zero (data type: float) is returned.</p>
<h4 id="mcetoc_1fvhtc1p6gl">Example Code</h4>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);

  String myString = "20.56";
  float myFloat = myString.toFloat(); //This is where the toFloat() Function is used
  Serial.println(myFloat);
}

void loop() {
}
</code></pre>
<p>You can copy this code to your Arduino IDE and try it out!</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1fvhtc1p6gm">Converting different data types to String</h3>
<p>The below code section shows how different data types can be converted to String.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">
String stringOne = "Hello String";                    // using a constant String
String stringOne = String('a');                       // converting a constant char into a String
String stringTwo = String("This is a string");        // converting a constant string into a String object
String stringOne = String(stringTwo + " with more");  // concatenating two strings
String stringOne = String(13);                        // using a constant integer
String stringOne = String(analogRead(0), DEC);        // using an int and a base
String stringOne = String(45, HEX);                   // using an int and a base (hexadecimal)
String stringOne = String(255, BIN);                  // using an int and a base (binary)
String stringOne = String(millis(), DEC);             // using a long and a base
String stringOne = String(5.698, 3);                  // using a float and the decimal places
</code></pre>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1fvhtc1p6gn">Resources and Going Further</h2>
<p>For the more experienced programmers amongst you, do keep in mind that Arduino uses variables in the same way C and C++ do. You can have special variables like unsigned variables (e.g. <code>unsigned int</code>) to represent positive-only numbers, as well as character arrays (e.g. <code>char myString[] = "string here";</code>) to represent a string instead of using Arduino's <code>String</code> object.</p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1fulqia872go">Naming your variables</h2>
<p>After some tinkering with your coding, you may realise that it may be a hassle to change for example a pin, like this example code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">
void setup()
{
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
}

void loop()
{
  digitalWrite(13, HIGH);
  delay(1000); // Wait for 1000 millisecond(s)
  digitalWrite(13, LOW);
  delay(1000); // Wait for 1000 millisecond(s)
}
</code></pre>
<p>Imagine that you would have to change all the <code>pin 13</code> to another pin, and would have to scan through the entire code just to change all these values! Isn't it a hassle to change all these numbers?</p>
<p><em>Introducing... Variable names. </em>😎 Here is a modified version of the code above:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">
int LED = 13;
int wait = 1000;

void setup()
{
  pinMode(LED, OUTPUT);
}

void loop()
{
  digitalWrite(LED, HIGH);
  delay(wait); // Wait for 1000 millisecond(s)
  digitalWrite(13, LOW);
  delay(wait); // Wait for 1000 millisecond(s)
}
</code></pre>
<p><em><strong>Voilà!</strong></em> I have managed to change all the numbers to variable names. For example, in the event I want to adjust the <code>delay()</code> function in the code, I just have to change the <code>1000</code> in the <code>int wait=1000;</code> into a different number! Now that's straightforward. <em>How about you try it out now?</em></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1fulqia872gp">Logic Operations</h2>
<p>Logical operations are introduced when we need to evaluate related expressions to return a single value. For this tutorial, we are going to introduce the AND/OR Operators.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1fulqia872gq">Some history...</h3>
<p>Back when technology was not this advanced, the various operators were actual hardware logic gates that were placed into the circuit. The chips looked something like this:</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/17/arduinoButton15.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" srcset="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/17/responsive/arduinoButton15-xs.jpg 300w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/17/responsive/arduinoButton15-sm.jpg 480w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/17/responsive/arduinoButton15-md.jpg 749w"  alt="" width="390" height="317"></figure>
<p>Technology has come a long way, squeezing billions of transistors inside a single chip to provide us with a fast, modern computer.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1fulqia872gr">AND Operator</h3>
<p>How it works is that if both Input 1 and Input 2 are <code>high</code>, it will give a <code>high</code> output, as illustrated in this table (emojis added to help you understand 😄):</p>
<table class="table-bordered" style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; height: 251.797px;" border="1">

<h2 id="mcetoc_1fulqia872gs">OR Operator</h2>
<p>How it works is that if either Input 1 <strong>OR</strong> Input 2 are <code>high</code>, it will give a <code>high</code> output. If both Inputs are <code>high</code>, it will also give a <code>high</code> output, as illustrated in this table (Emojis added to help you understand 😄): </p>

<p>Let us create a new circuit in TinkerCAD like this:</p>

<p>Next, we will need to edit the code such that the LED would light up once <strong>one</strong> of the buttons is pressed:</p>

<p>So would there be other ways to do it? <em>Certainly!</em> This is just one of the ways you can do it! There are many ways to make it work the same way also!</p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1fulqia872h1">Toggle Switch</h2>
<p>Let us assume that we only have a button to control our lighting. Based on previous examples, if you were want to light up the LED, you would have to press and hold the LED right? What if I was to use the washroom and want the lights to be on? I would then have to press and hold the button for the lights to remain on! 😱 To make our lives much better, we can make our button into a toggle switch with some coding... 🥳</p>
<p>Build a circuit as shown:</p>

<p>For the program, we would have to introduce variables. To create variables, navigate here:</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/17/arduinoButton27.png" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" srcset="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/17/responsive/arduinoButton27-xs.png 300w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/17/responsive/arduinoButton27-sm.png 480w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/17/responsive/arduinoButton27-md.png 749w"  alt="" width="260" height="230"></figure>
<p>Create the variables <code>btn</code> and <code>led</code>. We are going to use these variables to store the state of the button and LED. What this means is that if the button is pressed, I change the state of the variable, and it will remember the state. This also means that if I press and hold the button, it does not spam the ON command. It will just activate once. Same with the LED.</p>
<p>Here is how the program can be coded:</p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1fulqiifr2he">Pull-up resistors</h2>
<p>Pull-up resistors are found in digital logic devices and microcontrollers. When a pin in say, the SSTuino is connected as an input and tries to read the state of the pin, it is very difficult to determine whether the pin is actually high or low, due to a lot of factors such as noise in the circuit. This effect is referred to as floating.<br><br>To eliminate this, we will place a pull-up resistor to ensure that the pin is either in its <code>HIGH</code> or <code>LOW</code> state, while using a little bit of current. Pull-up resistors are usually used on buttons and switches where there is a possibility of signal noise.</p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1fulqiifr2hg">Buttons and If/Else Statement</h2>
<p>We are going to read very simple data from a push button, to know whether it has been pressed or not. Set up your circuit as shown:</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/15/arduinoButton1-2.png" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" srcset="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/15/responsive/arduinoButton1-2-xs.png 300w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/15/responsive/arduinoButton1-2-sm.png 480w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/15/responsive/arduinoButton1-2-md.png 749w"  alt="" width="1809" height="789"></figure>
<p>Next, go to the coding section and then program it like this:</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/15/arduinoButton2-2.png" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" srcset="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/15/responsive/arduinoButton2-2-xs.png 300w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/15/responsive/arduinoButton2-2-sm.png 480w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/15/responsive/arduinoButton2-2-md.png 749w"  alt="" width="639" height="329"></figure>
<p>What this code does is that the Arduino would wait for the button to be pressed. <strong>If</strong> the button is not pressed, it would output "Not pressed!" in the serial monitor. <strong>Else</strong>, it would output "pressed!" in the serial monitor. This is how a simple If/Else statement works!</p>
<p>Now start the simulation and then press the serial monitor:</p>

<p>Let's copy this circuit to your SSTuino! </p>
<p class="msg msg--warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> To prevent damage to your Learning Device or your components, please <strong>do not connect the SSTuino to your LD or power supply</strong> when you are wiring up your circuit. </p>
<p>After the code has been uploaded to the SSTuino, let's head to the serial monitor of the Arduino IDE:</p>
<div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery"  data-is-empty="false" data-translation="Add images" data-columns="3">
<figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/15/gallery/arduinoButton29.png" data-size="1002x494"><img loading="lazy" src="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/15/gallery/arduinoButton29-thumbnail.png" alt="" width="749" height="369"></a>
<figcaption>You can click on the top right hand corner of the Arduino IDE,</figcaption>

<figcaption>or go to Tools &gt; Serial Monitor.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div></div>
<p>Here is how the circuit looks like:</p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1fulqiifr2hh">Control your lights</h2>
<p><em>This time with coding! </em>😁 With the data we have read from the push button, we can use it to trigger a reaction. Set up your circuit in TinkerCAD as shown:</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/15/arduinoButton4-2.png" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" srcset="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/15/responsive/arduinoButton4-2-xs.png 300w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/15/responsive/arduinoButton4-2-sm.png 480w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/15/responsive/arduinoButton4-2-md.png 749w"  alt="" width="1929" height="853"></figure>
<p>Next, we will need to edit the code such that the LED will light up when the button is pressed:</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/15/arduinoButton5.png" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" srcset="https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/15/responsive/arduinoButton5-xs.png 300w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/15/responsive/arduinoButton5-sm.png 480w ,https://knowledge.fourier.industries/media/posts/15/responsive/arduinoButton5-md.png 749w"  alt="" width="1064" height="680"></figure>
<p>The block code is similar to the previous exercise, but with LEDs added this time. This will happen after you start simulation:</p>

    <source src="media/files/arduinoButton31.mp4" type="video/mp4" /></video></figure>
<p>Let's copy this circuit over to your SSTuino! This is how it should look like:</p>

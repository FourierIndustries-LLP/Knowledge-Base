Refunds will be completed once we confirm that the product was received in good condition. Return shipment is the responsibility of the customer. Please contact us directly for returns! We will try our best to cater to your needs. </p><h2 id="mcetoc_1g4v24aos7r">Warranty</h2><p>We warrant that all FourierIndustries LLP products will be free from manufacturing defects for a period of thirty (30) days following the date of delivery to you. We will replace, repair, or credit you for any confirmed defective product at our option. </p><p>Warranty will not apply if the Product fails or is damaged after delivery to you due to accident, abuse or misuse.</p><p>For extended warranty covering enterprises or educational institutions, please reach out to us at hello@fourier.industries.</p><p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT ALLOWED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS LIMITED WARRANTIES SET FORTH ABOVE, PRODUCTS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” AND FOURIERINDUSTRIES LLP AND ITS SUPPLIERS MAKE NO WARRANTIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, BY OPERATION OF LAW OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE PRODUCTS. FOURIERINDUSTRIES LLP DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE PRODUCTS AND CONTENT WILL OPERATE ERROR-FREE, UNINTERRUPTED, OR THAT THEY WILL BE SECURE OR VIRUS-FREE.

The “Be Nice” policy applies to all members: employees, customers, educators, makers, content creators and many more. This policy applies to all of the interactions that affect the communities that we have all built together: posting in Discord/WhatsApp, technical support tickets, and treatment of our support staff. </p><p>As such, we hold ourselves and members of our community to high standards of excellence. Every member is valuable to us and we are committed to maintaining a positive environment where people from all walks of life can engage, learn and share their work. In the vast majority of circumstances, our members are respectful and awesome. That is something worth protecting. </p><p>Once in a while, we do encounter someone who has decided to cause problems, is not reasonable, or chooses not to be solutions-oriented. If a customer swears, uses abusive language, refuses to work with our staff in forums such as Discord/WhatsApp, cannot work together positively with other members, or otherwise ignores the “Be Nice” code of conduct, we will redirect the customer to another supplier for future purchases. When appropriate, we may choose to ban the former customer from making future purchases or engaging with our communities. We reserve the right at all times to remove any information or materials that are unlawful, threatening, abusive, libellous, defamatory, obscene, vulgar, pornographic, profane, indecent or otherwise objectionable. These cases are rare, but we believe this is an important step to take to ensure the safety of our employees, other customers, and all other wonderful members of our community.</p><p>What we expect of our community members:</p><ul><li>Be inclusive: We believe in a diverse community and will not tolerate any conduct or speech that excludes, discriminates, or is intolerant against others. Any of such behaviour will not be tolerated. Do not intimidate or harass others.</li><li>Be respectful: You might not agree with us or other community members, but that is not an excuse for disrespectful behaviour. If you have disagreements, please channel that into more positive and conducive discussions and refrain from personal attacks. </li><li>Be patient: Not everyone has the same skill level. Always be patient when explaining a new concept to someone else, who may not have the same skill level as you. Teaching is the best way to learn!</li><li>Communicate carefully: If you are unsure, clarify with one another. Effective communication is the best way to solve any misunderstandings.</li></ul><h2 id="mcetoc_1g4v24aos7t">Safety</h2><p>Technology is constantly changing and evolving, and so does the laws and content creation that surrounds them.
